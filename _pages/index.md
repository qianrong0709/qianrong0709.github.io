__Research__: As a researcher in machine learning, I am focused on developing scalable methods for modeling, analyzing and generating complex, high-dimensional data. My interest spans multiple areas, including generative modeling, representation learning, probabilistic inference, AI safety, and AI for science. My ultimate goal is to address problems that have wide-ranging significance, develop methods that are both accessible and effective, and build intelligent systems that can improve human lives.


__Previously__: I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University, advised by Stefano Ermon. I was a research intern at Google Brain, Uber ATG, and Microsoft Research. I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Physics from Tsinghua University, where I worked with Jun Zhu, Raquel Urtasun, and Richard Zemel.

Hello! this is Rohan Deb Sarkar. Welcome to my website.

I am currently an undergraduate student at the physics department of Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, Kolkata. While Physics is my major subject, Mathematics and Computer Science are my minor subjects.

I finished my senior secondary (XII Standard) schooling from International Public School, Kolkata. My major subjects of focus were Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science.

I am dedicated to science and keen to utilize my knowledge in the best interests of science, humankind, and this planet. My interests include Physics, Computer Science, and a bit of Mathematics.

I am seeking to research and learn about things that are unknown to me.
