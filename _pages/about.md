I am **Rong Qian**, a PhD student at **Hong Kong Baptist University**, specializing in **AI for Drug Discovery (AIDD)**. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Life Sciences, focusing on developing advanced deep learning frameworks to accelerate drug discovery and understand molecular systems.


### 🔬 Research Interests
* **Geometric Deep Learning**: Modeling 3D molecular structures and protein-ligand interactions.
* **Molecular Generation**: Developing diffusion models and flow matching for 3D molecule generation.
* **Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD)**: Accelerating drug discovery processes through AI-driven methods.

### 🔥 News
* **2026.01**: Conducting research on phenotype-based molecule generation.
* **2025.12**: Working on the evaluation and improvement of 3D generative models (e.g., PocketGPT).
